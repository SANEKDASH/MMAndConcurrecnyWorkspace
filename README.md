### How to install and use
1. You need a `git` utile. If you don't know what it is, please, use next to commend in terminal to check and install it
```
sudo apt install git
```
2. Now you can clone git repo with `git clone /* repo URL */` commend
3. We will use VS Code as main IDE. There are many ways to install it. Here you can install it by hands ([link](https://code.visualstudio.com/)). Also you can use UI installer.
4. For work you need utils that you can install using next commend:
```
sudo apt install g++ cmake clang-format clang-tidy-14
```
5. Finally we need next VS Code extentions for correct work with code: "C/C++ Extention Pack", "clangd". Also you need to install clangd server. Additionlly, you can install "vim" extention.

### Tasks
Here you can find tasks you can do. They are placed in `memory_managemend` and `concurrency` dirs. We recomend you to start with mm tasks.

Completed tasks are stored in coresponding branches. 

For example: you can see the implementation of lock free stack data structure in branch [lock_free_stack](https://github.com/SANEKDASH/MMAndConcurrecnyWorkspace/tree/lock_free_stack).
